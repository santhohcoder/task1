Question 1  Write the difference between Window Object and the Document Object

 a)In  Window Object, It is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy 
But in case of document object ,Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object.
The document contains the contents of the page. Using document object, JavaScript can modify, add and delete the HTML elements, attributes CSS styles in the page

b)The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document 
where as document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

c)You can access a document object either using window.document property or using document object directly as window is global object. 
 
d) Although both window and Document object has the same methods but the function of those methods differ, In such a way that
in case of Document Object create will create an new or empty document but in case of window object an new tab will be opened.
 
e)Window Object=Global object
We can refer it directly by property name alone no need to mention window.
 Document Object= Sub category of Window Object
 We need to refer it using window.document. operator...

 f)The most important/frequently used object under the window object is the document object. 
 It contains the rendered HTML of the current page. 
 Window object in JS represent the current window open in your browser. 
 It contains information related to your current browser window.
